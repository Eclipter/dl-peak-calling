# DL Peak Caller

## Requirements
1. Anacoda.

## Start
1. Clone this repo.
2. Follow the code in the `script.ipynb`. The code is writen in such a way that it allows to get the work done while staying inside the jupyter notebook (except the distributed training).
3. For distributed (using >1 GPU) training execute the `script.ipynb` from top to bottom once. Magic functions will automatically copy some cells to the `script.py` which you then need to launch from the command line. Use the cell in the top of the notebook the erase the `script.py` if something went wrong and you couldn't execute the notebook from top to bottom once.
